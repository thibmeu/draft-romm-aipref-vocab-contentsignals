               Vocabulary For Expressing Content Signals
                draft-romm-aipref-contentsignals-latest

Abstract

   This Internet Draft proposes three categories that would enable
   parties to express preferences regarding how digital assets are used
   by automated processing systems.  The proposal is for these
   categories to nest within the larger category of Automated
   Processing, currently envisaged in the [AIPREF-VOCAB].

1.  Introduction

   This proposal introduces and aims to define a specific set of
   preferences to address the need for expressing how digital assets can
   be used by automated systems, particularly in the context of training
   artificial intelligence (AI) models and generating search results.
   These preference categories enable clear and explicit communication
   of preferences regarding the use of digital assets for search
   indexing and AI training.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   For the purposes of this document, in addition to the definitions in
   Section 4 of [AIPREF-VOCAB], the following terms are used:

   *  *Search Results:* hyperlinks and short excerpts returned from
      contents of the retrieved asset(s)

   *  *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):* A technique where external
      content is retrieved at query time and supplied to a model to
      condition the generated output.  See [SUBSTITUTIVE-VOCAB]

3.  Vocabulary Definition

3.1.  Search

   The act of using one or more assets to build a search index and
   provide Search Results.  Search does not include providing AI-
   generated search summaries.  The use of assets for Search is a proper
   subset of Automated Processing usage.

3.2.  AI Input

   The act of inputting an asset or assets into one or more AI models
   for purposes of retrieval-augmented generation, grounding, or other
   real-time taking of content for generative AI search answers.  The
   use of assets for AI Input is a proper subset of Automated Processing
   usage.

3.3.  AI Training

   The act of training or fine-tuning AI models.  The use of assets for
   AI Training is a proper subset of Automated Processing usage.

4.  Usage Category Labels

   Each usage category in Section 3 is mapped to a short textual label.
   Table 1 specifies this mapping.

                 +=============+==========+=============+
                 | Category    | Label    | Reference   |
                 +=============+==========+=============+
                 | Search      | search   | Section 3.1 |
                 +-------------+----------+-------------+
                 | AI Input    | ai-input | Section 3.2 |
                 +-------------+----------+-------------+
                 | AI Training | ai-train | Section 3.3 |
                 +-------------+----------+-------------+

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Addendum

   The definition definition for Search (3.1) provided in this document
   may be replaced with the Search Category definition proposed in
   [AIPREF-VOCAB] and copied below: Using one or more assets in a search
   application that directs users to the location from which the assets
   were retrieved.  Search applications can be complex and may serve
   multiple purposes.  Only those parts of applications that direct
   users to the location of an asset are included in this category of
   use.  This includes the use of titles or excerpts from assets that
   are used to help users select between multiple candidate options.
   Preferences for the Search category apply to those parts of
   applications that provide search capabilities, regardless of what
   other preferences are stated.  Parts of applications that do not
   direct users to the location of assets, such as summaries, are not
   covered by this category of use.  The use of assets for Search is a
   proper subset of Automated Processing usage.
